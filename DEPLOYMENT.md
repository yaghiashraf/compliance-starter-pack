# Deployment Instructions

## ðŸš€ Ready to Deploy with Real Stripe Payments!

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add real Stripe payment processing"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Configure Netlify Environment Variables

Go to your Netlify dashboard: https://app.netlify.com/sites/compliance-sp/settings/deploys#environment-variables

Add these environment variables:

**Frontend (Public - Safe to expose):**
```
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_publishable_key_from_stripe_dashboard
```

**Backend (Secret - Never expose):**
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_secret_key_from_stripe_dashboard
```

> **Note**: Use your actual Stripe keys from your Stripe dashboard. Never commit these keys to version control - only add them in Netlify's environment variables.

### 3. Configure Custom Domain

In Netlify dashboard:
1. Go to Site settings > Domain management
2. Add custom domain: `complianceservice.solutions`
3. Follow DNS configuration instructions
4. Enable HTTPS (automatic with Netlify)

### 4. Test Payment Flow

1. Visit your site
2. Fill out the form
3. Go through checkout with a test card:
